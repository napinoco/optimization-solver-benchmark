# Development Tasks - ProblemData Architecture Analysis

**Phase**: Architecture Analysis & Planning  
**Priority**: High - User-requested ProblemData unification analysis  
**Context**: Investigate feasibility of SeDuMi-like ProblemData unification

The user has requested analysis of a major ProblemData refactoring to unify all optimization problems under a SeDuMi-like format. This requires careful analysis before implementation to ensure compatibility with current production system.

## Active Task Queue (Execute Sequentially per conventions.md)

### **Task 1: Analyze Current ProblemData Usage** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Objective**: Comprehensively analyze current ProblemData field usage across codebase  
**Context**: User requests SeDuMi unification but must understand impact on existing system

**Steps**:
1. Document all current ProblemData field usage in loaders (MAT, DAT)
2. Document all ProblemData field usage in solvers (SciPy, CVXPY) 
3. Analyze which fields are essential vs optional for each problem type
4. Identify potential breaking changes from removing A_ub, b_ub, bounds
5. Document current CVXPY field usage (cvxpy_problem, variables, objective, constraints)

**Test Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete mapping of field usage across MAT/DAT loaders
- [ ] Complete mapping of field usage across SciPy/CVXPY solvers
- [ ] Impact assessment for A_ub/b_ub/bounds removal
- [ ] Impact assessment for CVXPY field removal
- [ ] Compatibility analysis with external libraries (DIMACS/SDPLIB)

**Definition of Done**: Comprehensive analysis document showing current usage and refactoring impact

### **Task 2: Validate SeDuMi Compatibility** üîç HIGH PRIORITY  
**Objective**: Verify that SeDuMi format can represent all current problem types
**Context**: Must ensure no loss of functionality with format change

**Steps**:
1. Test current DIMACS problems: verify they have cone_structure in metadata
2. Test current SDPLIB problems: verify they have cone_structure in metadata  
3. Analyze if SeDuMi format can represent current LP/QP constraint patterns
4. Verify that A_eq-only representation works for all current problems
5. Test conversion of A_ub constraints to A_eq format with slack variables

**Test Criteria**:
- [ ] All DIMACS problems have usable cone_structure data
- [ ] All SDPLIB problems have usable cone_structure data
- [ ] A_ub to A_eq conversion preserves problem semantics
- [ ] No loss of problem representation capability

**Definition of Done**: Verification that all current problems are compatible with SeDuMi format

### **Task 3: Design Migration Strategy** üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Objective**: Create step-by-step migration plan with backward compatibility
**Context**: Large refactoring requires careful planning to avoid system breakage

**Steps**:
1. Design backward-compatible ProblemData interface
2. Plan gradual migration of loaders (MAT first, then DAT)
3. Plan gradual migration of solvers (test compatibility)
4. Design validation tests for each migration step
5. Create rollback plan if migration fails

**Test Criteria**:
- [ ] Migration plan maintains system functionality at each step
- [ ] Backward compatibility preserved during transition
- [ ] Clear rollback procedure defined
- [ ] All current tests continue to pass

**Definition of Done**: Detailed migration plan with risk mitigation

### **Task 4: Create Proof of Concept** üî¨ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Objective**: Implement small-scale proof of concept for SeDuMi format
**Context**: Validate approach before full implementation

**Steps**:
1. Create experimental ProblemData class with SeDuMi format
2. Implement converter from current format to SeDuMi format
3. Test with one DIMACS problem (nb) and one SDPLIB problem (arch0)
4. Verify CVXPY solver can handle converted problems
5. Compare results between old and new format

**Test Criteria**:
- [ ] Experimental class successfully created
- [ ] Conversion preserves problem semantics
- [ ] Solver produces identical results with both formats
- [ ] No performance regression observed

**Definition of Done**: Working proof of concept with verified results

## Analysis Requirements (Per conventions.md)

### **Sequential Execution Protocol**
1. **Complete Task 1 first** - Full analysis before any implementation
2. **Stop for user approval** after each task completion
3. **No implementation** until analysis is complete and approved
4. **Risk assessment** at each step to protect production system

### **Success Criteria for Analysis Phase**
- **Impact Assessment**: Clear understanding of refactoring scope and risks
- **Compatibility Verification**: Proof that SeDuMi format works with all current problems
- **Migration Plan**: Step-by-step approach with risk mitigation
- **Proof of Concept**: Small-scale validation of approach

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Preserve Current System**: All analysis done without breaking existing functionality
- **Gradual Approach**: No big-bang refactoring, incremental changes only
- **Validation at Each Step**: Comprehensive testing before proceeding
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert if issues discovered

## Success Criteria

**Analysis Completion**:

## Important Notes

**Per conventions.md Requirements**:
- **One task at a time**: Complete Task 1 before proceeding to Task 2
- **User approval required**: Stop after each task for approval before continuing
- **Production system protection**: No changes that risk current functionality
- **Comprehensive testing**: Validate all assumptions before implementation

**This analysis phase ensures that the user's requested ProblemData unification is technically sound and implementable without risking the current production-ready system.**
