# Development Tasks - Architecture Optimization & Maintenance

**Phase**: Architecture Optimization & Maintenance  
**Priority**: Medium - System is production-ready, focusing on optimization and maintenance  
**Context**: Completed architecture simplification and external library focus

The benchmark system has achieved production-ready status with comprehensive external problem libraries (DIMACS + SDPLIB) and 9 major solvers. Current development focuses on maintenance, optimization, and addressing any emerging needs.

## Current System Status ‚úÖ

**Completed Major Milestones**:
- ‚úÖ **Complete External Library Integration**: 139+ problems (DIMACS: 47, SDPLIB: 92+)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Solver Support**: 9 solvers (SciPy, CLARABEL, SCS, ECOS, OSQP, CVXOPT, SDPA, SCIP, HiGHS)
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Simplification**: Direct registry iteration, --library_names separation
- ‚úÖ **Focused Problem Set**: External libraries only (removed internal synthetic problems)
- ‚úÖ **Testing Infrastructure**: --dry-run mode for development/testing
- ‚úÖ **Database Enhancements**: Memo column for result annotations

**Key Architecture Achievements**:
- Simplified loader architecture (MAT + DAT loaders only)
- Clean separation of library filtering (--library_names) vs problem filtering (--problems)
- Dry-run mode for testing without database pollution
- Streamlined codebase focused on real-world optimization problems

## Active Task Queue (Execute if Needed)

### **Task 1: Documentation Maintenance** ‚≠ê MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Objective**: Keep documentation synchronized with recent architecture changes  
**Context**: Recent simplification requires documentation updates

**Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Update tasks.md to reflect current system status
2. Update detail_design.md to remove light_set references and unused loaders
3. Update basic_design.md to reflect external-only problem approach  
4. Update history.md to document recent architecture optimization phase

**Test Criteria**:
- [ ] All documentation reflects current architecture (no light_set references)
- [ ] CLI options documented correctly (--library_names, --dry-run)
- [ ] Problem counts accurate (external libraries only)
- [ ] Loader architecture correctly described (MAT/DAT only)

**Definition of Done**: Documentation accurately reflects current simplified architecture

### **Task 2: Solver Performance Analysis** üîç LOW PRIORITY
**Objective**: Analyze solver performance patterns across problem types  
**Context**: Rich dataset available for performance insights

**Steps**:
1. Generate comprehensive benchmark reports with current solver set
2. Identify solver strengths/weaknesses by problem type (LP, QP, SOCP, SDP)
3. Document solver recommendations for different use cases
4. Create performance comparison charts for publication

**Test Criteria**:
- [ ] Performance data collected across all problem types
- [ ] Solver recommendations documented
- [ ] Performance insights suitable for research publication

**Definition of Done**: Comprehensive solver performance analysis available

### **Task 3: Database Query Optimization** üöÄ LOW PRIORITY  
**Objective**: Optimize database queries for better report generation performance
**Context**: Large dataset may benefit from query optimization

**Steps**:
1. Profile current report generation performance
2. Analyze database query patterns in HTMLGenerator and DataExporter
3. Add database indexes for common query patterns
4. Benchmark performance improvements

**Test Criteria**:
- [ ] Report generation time measured and optimized
- [ ] Database queries efficiently indexed
- [ ] No regressions in functionality

**Definition of Done**: Improved report generation performance
