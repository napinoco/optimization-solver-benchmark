- ✅ Aligns with open science principles and research community needs
- ✅ LICENSE file is properly formatted with standard MIT License text

**Documentation**: MIT license verified as appropriate for open-source benchmark framework

### Task 64: Implement Preview Hosting for CI ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Objective**: Add temporary hosting during CI for HTML preview before live deployment

**Implementation Results**:
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/pr-preview.yml` for automated PR preview deployment
- ✅ Replaced with `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4` for reliable deployment
- ✅ Added explicit GITHUB_TOKEN for permission issues resolution
- ✅ Automatic PR comments with preview links and report navigation
- ✅ Preview environment indicators and metadata for clear identification
- ✅ Auto-cleanup when PR is closed to maintain repository hygiene
- ✅ Lightweight benchmark configuration for fast preview generation
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` for main branch auto-deployment
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation in [PR_PREVIEW_GUIDE.md](../guides/PR_PREVIEW_GUIDE.md)

**Features Implemented**:
- 🚧 Visual preview environment indicators on all HTML pages
- 💬 Automatic PR comments with preview URLs and report links
- 🔄 Auto-updates when new commits are pushed to PR
- 🧹 Automatic cleanup when PR is closed
- 📊 Complete benchmark report suite in preview
- 🔗 Preview URLs: `https://[owner].github.io/[repo]/pr-preview/pr-[number]/`

**Technical Details**:
- **Deployment Method**: GitHub Pages with "Deploy from a branch" (gh-pages)
- **Main Site**: Auto-deploys from main branch to gh-pages root via deploy-pages.yml
- **PR Previews**: Deploy to gh-pages/pr-preview/pr-{number}/ via pr-preview.yml
- **Benchmark Config**: Lightweight (scipy,cvxpy with light_set) for fast preview execution
- **Main Config**: Full benchmark (scipy,cvxpy,highs,osqp with standard_set) for production
- **Permissions**: contents: write for gh-pages push, explicit GITHUB_TOKEN usage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive status reporting and debugging in workflows

## Task Management Protocol

### Development Workflow
1. **Complete one task at a time** following priority order
2. **Test implementation** using provided test criteria
3. **Stop and wait** for user review after each task
4. **Commit changes** only after user confirmation
5. **Proceed to next task** once approved

### Task Status Indicators
- ✅ **Completed**: Task finished and tested
- 🚧 **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- ⏳ **Pending**: Not yet started
