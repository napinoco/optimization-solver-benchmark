## Task Management Protocol

### Development Workflow
1. **Complete one task at a time** following priority order
2. **Test implementation** using provided test criteria
3. **Stop and wait** for user review after each task
4. **Commit changes** only after user confirmation
5. **Proceed to next task** once approved

### Task Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Task finished and tested
- üöß **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: Not yet started
